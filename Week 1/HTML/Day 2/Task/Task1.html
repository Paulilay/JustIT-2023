    <h1>Counter Strike: The AK-47</h1>

    <img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/182717773/photo/ak-47.jpg?s=612x612&w=is&k=20&c=RfdK-fUdqgSqCWiUqP6XuHlfIMCWmoGml89MEerwIU0=">

    <p>The AK-47, or CV-47 as it was previously known before Global Offensive, is a rifle featured in the Counter-Strike series, 
        exclusively available to the Terrorists. The counterpart for the Counter-Terrorists is the Maverick M4A1 Carbine before 
        Global Offensive and the M4A4 / M4A1-S in Global Offensive.</p>

    <p>The AK-47 in Global Offensive is modeled after the AKMN, a variant of the AKM which can attach Warsaw Pact optics to its dovetail mount.
        In-game, the AK-47 is a powerful assault rifle exclusive to the Terrorists. It is one of the most popular and efficient guns in the game known for its power, range, and cheap price.</p>
